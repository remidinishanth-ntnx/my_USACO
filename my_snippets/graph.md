## Finding cycle in (directed) graph

### Tarjan's strongly connected components algorithm
// Use colors, for example, white, grey and black.
// You can even find the edges in the cycle.

```cpp
vector<vector<int>> Adj;
vector<int> V;  // To store color of vertices (visited)
bool flag=true;
void dfs(int u){
    V[u]=1; // GREY
    for(int v:Adj[u]){
        if(V[v]==1){ flag=false;  // Cycle detected
            // you found a cycle, it's easy to recover it now.
        }
        else if(V[v]==0) dfs(v);
    }
    V[u]=2; // BLACK
}

for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    if(color[i] == 0) dfs(i, -1); // IF NODE IS WHITE, START NEW DFS
```

## Def
Let G = (V; E) be a connected, undirected graph. An articulation point of G is
a vertex whose removal disconnects G. A bridge of G is an edge whose removal
disconnects G. A biconnected component of G is a maximal set of edges such
that any two edges in the set lie on a common simple cycle, We can determine articulation points, bridges, and biconnected
components using DFS.
    
## Articulation Points

An ‘Articulation Point’ is defined as a vertex in a graph G whose removal (all edges
incident to this vertex are also removed) disconnects G. A graph without any articulation
point is called ‘Biconnected’. Similarly, a ‘Bridge’ is defined as an edge in a graph G whose
removal disconnects G. These two problems are usually defined for undirected graphs

## Single Source Shortest Paths on Weighted Tree

Generally we use Dijkstra's O((V+E)logV) and Bellman-Ford's O(VE) algorithms for solving SSP problem on weighted graph. But if the 
given graph is a weighted tree, the SSSP problem becomes simpler: Any O(V) graph traversal algorithm, i.e BFS or DFS can be used to solve
this problem. There is only one unique path between any two vertices in a tree, so we simply traverse the tree to find the unique path connecting 
the two vertices. The shortest path weight between these two vertices is basically the sum of edge weights of this unique path.

## Diameter of Weighted Tree

For general graph, we need O(V^3) Floyd Warshall's algorithm plus O(V^2) all-pairs check to compute the diameter. However,
if the given graph is a weighted tree, the problem becomes simpler. We only need two O(V) traversals: 
* Do DFS/BFS from any vertex s to find the furthest vertex x,
* Do DFS/BFS one more time from vertex x to get the true furthest vertex y from x.

The length of the unique path along x to y is the diameter of that tree.
