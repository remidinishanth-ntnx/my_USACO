An ‘Articulation Point’ is defined as a vertex in a graph G whose removal (all edges
incident to this vertex are also removed) disconnects G. A graph without any articulation
point is called ‘Biconnected’. Similarly, a ‘Bridge’ is defined as an edge in a graph G whose
removal disconnects G. These two problems are usually defined for undirected graphs
