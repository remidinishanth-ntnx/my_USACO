* Given is a trial that succeeds in probability p ( p ≠ 0 ) . Then the expected number of trials until the first success (including the last succeeding one) 
is `1/p` . 

Proof: Let X be the desired expected value. After a trial, we can terminate the trials if it is successful, while we go back to the starting point if unsuccessful; 
therefore we have equation `X = 1 + ( 1 − p ) X` . By transformation we have `p X = 1` , thus `X = 1/p` .
