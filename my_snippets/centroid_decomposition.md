# Centroid Decomposition

## Problem & Motivation

Given a tree, we are asked to find all the number of pairs `(u, v)` such that `dist(u, v) â‰¤ D`.

**Solution**

Let us fix one node of Tree by picking a vertex of the tree and call it `c`. Now let us split all the possible paths into classes: 
1) Some of the paths may not include this vertex `c`, then it will be completely inside one of the subtrees formed after removing `c`.
2) If the path includes node `c`, then we can break into two segments `u to c` and `c to v`.

We can use Centroid decomposition technique to solve this problem. Centroid Decomposition is just a divide and conquer technique which is used on trees and turns out useful in many problems.
