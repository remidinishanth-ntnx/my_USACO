# Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming (from now on abbreviated as DP) is perhaps the most challenging
problem-solving technique among Divide and Conquer, Greedy and complete search paradigms.

The key skills that we have to develop in order to master DP are the abilities to determine the problem states and to determine the relationships or transitions between current
problems and their sub-problems
