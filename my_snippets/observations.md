* Whenever you see, there is atleast `⌈N/2⌉` or `⌈N/3⌉` elements in the answer, see if you can use randomization. Say we need to have atleast `⌈N/2⌉` elements in the answer, if we choose a person at random, there is half probability that element is in the answer. So if we repeat this process say 30 times, then the probability of failure reduces to `(1/2)^30`. Hence this works most of the time.
